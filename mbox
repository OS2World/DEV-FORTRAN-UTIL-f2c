f2c's formatted I/O (at least the little I've tried)
seems to work with Sun's libF77 and libI77 on sol;
some list-directed I/O works, but not character
strings -- Sun's f77 issues different calls for them.

f2c.news (dmg) Fri Aug  4 17:24:39 1989

   Now available for "friendly use", f2c converts Fortran 77
   source code to C.  By default, it tries for bit-level
   compatibility with f77.  Usage:
	   f2c [flags] file ...
   File names must end in .f or .F; corresponding .c files are
   produced in the current directory (unless no file arguments
   are given, in which case f2c acts as a filter).  `man f2c`
   describes flags and other details.  Bug reports to dmg.


From dmg Sat Aug  5 13:21:08 EDT 1989
I've tweaked things in netlib/f2c so one can pass options by
having the first line after "execute f2c" begin with "c$f2c ",
followed by options.  Source for F2cargs is /n/pipe/usr/dmg/f2c/F2cargs.c .
(This also involved tweaking /n/crab/usr/ehg/bin/netlib.f2c .)

Quietly allow names up to 8 characters long (except under -ext).
Complain about, then ignore arguments to a main program.
Under -u, complain just once about each undeclared variable.

Subject: f2c help

Hi,

I promise not inundate all of you with so much Email in the future.
We tried the 'f2c' translator (or at least Bertice Haines did) and
she sent me the following Email.

======================================================================
Tom
It doesn't look like I'm going to get very far with the fortran
to C translator.  It considers variables longer than six characters
to be errors and truncates them.  It also mentions libraries that
we don't have and need a header file called f2c.h

/*  -- translated by f2c (version 0.6, all of Fortran 77).

*/

#include "f2c.h"
========================================================================

I was wondering if anyone else had complained about these issues.
Our Fortran compiler cft77 allows longer variable names.  Also
can I get a copy of the "f2c.h" header.  And finally, can anyone
tell me what the libraries libF77.a and libI77.a contain.  I'd
really like to use 'f2c' as a way of finding out where the Standard C
compiler is deficient (performance wise).  It also might help me understand
what I need to do to support your C environment.

Thanks for your help.

Oops, the system truncated my message.  Here goes another try...

[long names]  I also consider Fortran names of more than 6 characters
to be errors.  But David sent out mail this morning saying that f2c
would now allow names up to 8 characters;  perhaps that will help.
But in the final analysis, this is Fortran77->C, not CFT->C.

[libraries and headers]  About a week ago, David also updated the
index file in netlib to point to these supplementary files.  Say
	mail netlib@research.att.com
	send f2c.h from f2c
	send libf77 from f2c
	send libi77 from f2c
and you'll get back the items you asked for.  I know it is a little
startling to see the converted code calling the Fortran runtime
library.  I understand that this policy was adopted in order that
the converted program would give output byte-for-byte identical with
the original Fortran.  Of course, this is only true on classical
Unix systems running Feldman's compiler.  Still, if you can match
these codes to your own runtime library closely enough, perhaps you
too can compare the Fortran and C output automatically.


Please pass along my best wishes to Bertice.  She did an
excellent job for us while she was at Murray Hill.

Eric

The message

is, according to the RFC822 mail standard, just one (continued)

Subject: Re:  netlib news

Eric,
I copies most things from /netlib/temp. I think I screwed up with /netlib/go,
so when you get a chance please put it back. I removed all files with 
the exception of admin. I haven't copied that yet, since I need to check
the index and LIBS before coping.

Does the newest version of netlib automatically do the f2c function?
I don't think I have the latest.
Jack

------m dongarra Sun Aug 26 17:29:12 EDT 1990

I don't remember what was in temp/go.  I'm running a complete check now
and that will cover any problems with go.

The f2c execution stuff here has lots of dmg (=David Gay) specific
file names, so when I copied the files to Oslo, I didn't bother to
install the executables.  I get the impression that most people
these days want to run it on their own machine anyway.  The main
motivation for sending a file to netlib would be as a quick test-run
or as a has-this-bug-been-fixed-yet test.  For those purposes, it
is probably best that they send the files to David's latest version
anyway.

Best wishes
Eric
